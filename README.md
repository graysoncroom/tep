Text Processor - the grace of Vim keybindings with a focus on Lisp development

I may come back at a future date and work on this project for real, but I kind of branched off and learned ncurses after I did this. I was not able to get Lisp bindings to the ncurses library to work, so if at somepoint I am able to install them without issues I will continue the development of this editor. Sorry.

This project has just been started. If you would like to offer input, advice, or ideas create an issue so I can hear from you!

As the project stands today, it resembles a very (read: extremely) shitty ed. Give it time and soon it will live up the the description it was given.

Language: Common Lisp
