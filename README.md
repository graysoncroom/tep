Text Processor - the grace of Vim keybindings with a focus on Lisp development

This project has just been started. If you would like to offer input, advice, or ideas create an issue so I can hear from you!

As the project stands today, it resembles a very (read: extremely) shitty ed. Give it time and soon it will live up the the description it was given.

Language: Common Lisp
